=========

Here lies the experiment reports of mine for the Modern Physics Laboratory
course at School of Physics, Peking University.

For the sake and benefit of others, I decided to put all these reports as
publicly avaliable.

All reports are written in Chinese.

Template
========

What's more, a template for Modern Physics Laboratory experiment reports is also
in this repository.

I firstly released this template (MplTplt.tex - Yet another LaTeX template for
Modern Physics Lab, PKU) as a
[gist](https://gist.github.com/chaserhkj/a8dc4752987ce295c3d7), but have now
decided to keep it maintained here.

For any issues about the template, please do not hesitate to mail me or submit
an issue here about it.

Build
=====

To build/typeset these reports, XeLaTeX is required.

A typical typesetting progress could be invoked by invoking

```
$ latexmk -xelatex text.tex
```
on linux platform.

On other platforms, please refer to your platform-specific TeX manual.
